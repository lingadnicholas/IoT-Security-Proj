lab4c_tcp.c:
    C source file that reads temperature and outputs to log file/TCP server
        Stopped either by ending program, OFF command
        Accepts commands from server that allow to change the temperature scale, pause/start, shut off, or log
            while the program is running.
lab4c_tls.c:
    C source file that reads temperature and outputs to log file/secure TLS server
        Stopped either by ending program, OFF command
        Accepts commands from server that allow to change the temperature scale, pause/start, shut off, or log
            while the program is running.
    Encrypts all communication, unlike tcp

Makefile:
    default: builds the executable ./lab4c_tcp from lab4c_tcp.c and ./lab4c_tls from lab4c_tls.c
    clean: cleans all files not in the tar
    dist: puts README, Makefile, lab4c_tcp.c, lab4c_tls.c into a tarball
